## Set up environment
We recommend you to set up a conda environment for packages used in this homework.

## If you are using lightning.ai you can skip conda commands and just install requirements in your studio

```
conda create -n 1011-hw3 python=3.12.11
conda activate 1011-hw3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
